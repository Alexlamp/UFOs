# UFOs

### Background

My webpage and dynamic table is working as intended, but needs to be filtered even further. While it was filtering by the date, I was asked to add the ability to filter by more column headers (Date, City, State, Country Shape). will go a long way in providing more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings.

I was tasked with the following: Creating a new function that will replace your handleClick(); function. This function saves the element, value, and the id of the filter that was changed. Create an if-else statement to add filter data from input, or clear the filter if no input data exists. Additionally, create a function named filterTable(); that will perform the following actions: Set the filtered data to the table. Loop through all of the filters and keep any data that matches the filter values.
Rebuild the table by calling the buildTable(); function created earlier. Finally, using d3.selectAll();, attach an event listener to pick up changes that are made to each filter.

### Technology Used

Javascript <br> 
HTML <br> 
CSS <br> 
Bootstrap <br> 
VS Code <br> 

### Recommendation

I recommend that we make the filter search for data table more powerful and user friendly. Potentially we can add a clear filter tab to improve user experience and a sorting feature to further drill down to the data the user is looking for.
